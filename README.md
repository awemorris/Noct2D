Noct2D
======

**Noct2D** is a lightweight scripting runtime for game
development, often described as a game engine.

It is designed to provide:

- A fast scripting language with JIT or AOT compilation
- Real-time graphics and audio capabilities
- Cross-platform deployment across desktops, mobile devices, and game consoles

Originally developed under the name **Fuel** and **NoctVM**, Noct2D
was reimagined to meet the demands of modern, production-ready
environments across diverse platforms.

## üß™ Example

Here's a simple example that displays an image following the mouse
cursor. This shows the basic lifecycle: `setup` (window config),
`start` (asset loading), and `frame` (per-frame logic).


```
func setup() {
    return {
        title: "My Sample Game",
        width: 640,
        height: 480
    };
}

func start() {
    App.myTexture = API.loadTexture({file: "apple.png"});
}

func frame() {
    API.renderTexture({
	dstLeft:   API.mousePosX,
	dstTop:    API.mousePosY,
	dstWidth:  App.myTexture.width,
	dstHeight: App.myTexture.height,
	texture:   App.myTexture,
	srcLeft:   0,
	srcTop:    0,
	srcWidth:  App.myTexture.width,
	srcHeight: App.myTexture.height,
	alpha:     255
    });
}
```

üìù Note: setup() defines the window, start() loads resources, and
frame() is called each frame to render and update.

## What's Noct2D?

_"If a game engine could run anywhere, how would the world change?"_

Noct2D was born from this single question.

Noct2D is a lightweight and flexible game engine written in C89,
designed to support creators across desktop, mobile, and console platforms.

It runs smoothly even on older or low-spec machines ‚Äî if you have a computer,
there's a place for you to create.

And if you're using something more powerful, like a modern MacBook or
iPhone, Noct2D adapts to draw out the full capabilities of your
device.

You don't need the latest or most expensive hardware. Noct2D helps you
go beyond your environment. It's a helpful companion for creators
everywhere ‚Äî especially in places with fewer resources.

The goal is simple:
**To make game development accessible, thoughtful, and within reach
for everyone.**

Create at your pace, wherever you are in the world.

## Technical Overview

### Core Architecture

* **C89**:
  Noct2D is implemented entirely in ANSI C (C89), making it highly
  portable and dependency-free.

* **Scripting**:
  Integrates [NoctLang](https://github.com/awemorris/NoctLang), a
  lightweight language designed for clarity, performance, and fast
  startup.

* **JIT Compilation**:
  Includes a built-in JIT compiler supporting multiple architectures.  
  For mobile platforms, ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation is also available.

* **Rendering**:
  Supports DirectX 9/11/12, Metal, OpenGL, and a fallback software
  renderer for wide compatibility.

* **Audio**:
  Provides lightweight audio support through DirectSound, Audio Unit,
  ALSA, and other APIs.

* **Small Footprint**:
  The entire runtime fits within ~2MB, making it suitable for embedded
  systems or constrained environments.

### Noct Language and Tools

**NoctLang** is a lightweight scripting language designed specifically
for Noct2D. With a game-oriented syntax, it emphasizes clarity,
instant startup, and tight integration with the engine.

The built-in JIT compiler supports a wide range of CPU architectures,
including: **x86, x86_64, Arm32, Arm64, PowerPC32, PowerPC64, MIPS32,
and MIPS64.**

For platforms where JIT is restricted (such as mobile or consoles),
NoctLang can fall back to AOT (ahead-of-time) compilation using a C
source backend ‚Äî ensuring full compatibility even in tightly
controlled environments.

## NoctScript IDE

**NoctScript** is the official IDE for Noct2D-based projects, designed
to streamline development and testing.

It includes:

- A built-in editor with syntax highlighting for NoctLang
- One-click run and debug support for Noct2D scripts
- Integrated asset preview and configuration panels
- A seamless workflow between code, assets, and runtime behavior

By separating the **core runtime (Noct2D)** from the **development
environment (NoctScript)**, you can choose to use the IDE when
convenient ‚Äî or embed Noct2D directly into your own tools and
pipelines.

## Why Noct2D?

Noct2D is for those who quietly hold a dream, and wish to share it, one

Creativity shouldn't depend on the power of your computer, where you
live, or what tools you have.

Noct2D was created with the belief that every creator deserves space
to explore, no matter their surroundings.

Whether you're using a Raspberry Pi in a classroom, or using a
UN-issued Chromebook in a temporary shelter, Noct2D offers gentle
tools to help bring your ideas to life ‚Äî in a way that feels simple,
thoughtful, and your own. If you have something to make, Noct2D will
be here to walk with you.

**Dreams fuel it ‚Äî and they're the only requirement.**
