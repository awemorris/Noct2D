## What's Noct2D?

‚ÄúIf a game engine could run anywhere, how would the world change?‚Äù

Noct2D was born from this single question.

Noct2D is a lightweight and flexible game engine written in C89,
designed to support creators across desktop, mobile, and console platforms.

It runs smoothly even on older or low-spec machines ‚Äî if you have a computer,
there's a place for you to create. üíªüå±

And if you're using something more powerful, like a modern MacBook or
iPhone, Noct2D adapts to draw out the full capabilities of your
device. üéÆüì±

You don't need the latest hardware. Noct2D helps you go beyond your
environment. It's a helpful companion for creators everywhere ‚Äî
especially in places with fewer resources.

Create at your pace, wherever you are in the world. üåç‚ú®

## Why Noct2D?

Noct2D is for those who quietly hold a dream, and wish to share it, one
small step at a time.

Creativity shouldn't depend on the power of your computer, where you
live, or what tools you have.

Noct2D was created with the hope that every creator deserves space to
explore, no matter their surroundings.

Whether you're using a Raspberry Pi in a classroom, or using a
UN-issued Chromebook in a temporary shelter ‚Äî including refugee camps
and disaster relief environments ‚Äî Noct2D offers gentle tools to help
bring your ideas to life ‚Äî in a way that feels simple, thoughtful,
and yours. If you have something to make, Noct2D will be here to walk
with you.

Dreams fuel it ‚Äî and they're the only requirement.

### NoctLang

`NoctLang` is a lightweight scripting language designed specifically
for Noct2D. Featuring a game-oriented syntax, it emphasizes clarity,
instant startup, and seamless integration with the engine.

Built-in JIT compiler supports multiple architectures:
**Both 32-bit and 64-bit of x86, Arm, RISC-V, PowerPC, MIPS.**

For platforms where JIT is restricted, its C source backend enables
AOT compilation, making it ideal for mobile deployment.
