## What's NoctVM?

‚ÄúIf a game engine could run anywhere, how would the world change?‚Äù

NoctScript was born from this single question.

NoctScript is a lightweight and flexible game engine written in C89,
designed to support creators across desktop, mobile, and console platforms.

It runs smoothly even on older or low-spec machines ‚Äî if you have a computer,
there's a place for you to create. üíªüå±

And if you're using something more powerful, like a modern MacBook or
iPhone, NoctVM adapts to draw out the full capabilities of your
device. üéÆüì±

You don't need the latest hardware. NoctVM helps you go beyond your
environment. It's a helpful companion for creators everywhere ‚Äî
especially in places with fewer resources.

Create at your pace, wherever you are in the world. üåç‚ú®

## Why NoctVM?

NoctVM is for those who quietly hold a dream, and wish to share it, one
small step at a time.

Creativity shouldn't depend on the power of your computer, where you
live, or what tools you have.

NoctVM was created with the hope that every creator deserves space to
explore, no matter their surroundings.

Whether you're using a Raspberry Pi in a classroom, or using a
UN-issued Chromebook in a temporary shelter ‚Äî including refugee camps
and disaster relief environments ‚Äî NoctVM offers gentle tools to help
bring your ideas to life ‚Äî in a way that feels simple, thoughtful,
and yours. If you have something to make, NoctVM will be here to walk
with you.

Dreams fuel it ‚Äî and they're the only requirement.

### NoctScript

`NoctScript` is a lightweight scripting language designed specifically for NoctVM.
Featuring a game-oriented syntax, it emphasizes clarity, instant startup,
and seamless integration with the engine.

Built-in JIT compiler supports multiple architectures:
**x86, x86_64, Arm32, Arm64, PowerPC32, PowerPC64, MIPS32, and MIPS64.**

For platforms where JIT is restricted, its C source backend enables
AOT compilation, making it ideal for mobile deployment.

`NoctScript` is also the product name for the binary distribution,
especially in Japanese-language materials and creator-facing documents.
This dual naming reflects the separation between the core runtime (NoctVM)
and the user-oriented scripting environment (NoctScript).
